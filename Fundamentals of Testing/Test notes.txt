What is a defect that causes the software to become unresponsive or break better known as? - Fatal Issue

Focuses on adhering to proper processes and ensuring test execution is undertaken to a high standard throughout the development process - Quality Assurance


Defects cluster together

The Pareto Principle is a risk analysis tool used in multiple fields of quality control
The Pareto principle is commonly interpreted as:
"80% of all bugs can be found in 20% of software"
A way to reframe this in the context of software testing is:
"50% of the software may contain 0% of defects"
Known commonly as the 80/20 Rule



Beware of the Pesticide Paradox

'Paradox of the Pesticides' is a term used to describe the potential effects of pesticide overuse
In pest management, it was historically understood that using large quantities of pesticide over time would increase a pest's resilience to the pesticide, eventually making it obsolete
When applied to software testing, the Pesticide Paradox describes how repetitive testing of certain elements will stop showing new defects
A more effective use of time could be to analyse the tests being undertaken and reconfigure them to be more suitable




Absence-of-errors is a fallacy

Testing for a project can be considered 'complete', however, that does not signify that the software is 100% free of defects.

Testing is designed to "show the presence of defects, not their absence".
Organisational expectations that testers can & will find every defect is an invalid train of thought as "Exhaustive testing is not possible".
The most thorough testing will not define the success of a product
Product may be inferior to competitors
Product may not be user friendly
Product may not fill user needs or expectations


What is a test basis?
The information required to start test analysis and begin writing test cases


Test work products, also known as artifacts, are constructed as a part of the test process.


Test Analysis
Test analysis is the process of determining what will be tested by analysing the test basis and test object.


"The test team manager compares the actual work being done with the expected testing progress"
Test Monitoring and Control


Congruence Bias
Congruence Bias is the failure or inability to consider alternatives to the expected.
Congruence bias can be considered a special case of confirmation bias.
Confirmation bias will see a person only seek out evidence that supports a currently held belief
Congruence bias is actively avoiding evidence that does not support or would dismantle a theory
